      "Our homework was to parallelize the bilateral filter program. This was the first time that I have actually read C++ code, so a lot of the code was rather criptic to me. What I ended up doing was parallelizing every for loop that I found, and checked whether the code ran faster or slower.\n",

      "\n",
      "Also, in the function BilateralFilter::apply, there was a critical section. I tried three different approaches\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Then I tried omp atomic which worked quite well, and I was going to leave it like that, but \n",

      "Finally I tried using reduce, which sped things up about two-fold. So that's where I left it.\n",
