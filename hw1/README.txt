Code for computing bilateral filtering of grayscale images stored in PGM files.
This code is based on code found at https://code.google.com/p/bilateralfilter/
This version removes the need for the OpenCV library by using simple PGM raw images for input
and output, and loses the ability to display the images.   It should compile on any system
with a C++ compiler.
